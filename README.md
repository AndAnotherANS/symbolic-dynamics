# Symbolic dynamics toolbox
## Overview:
The main goal of this project is to build a reusable collection of tools helpful in analysis and computation regarding
dynamical systems built on shift spaces. Since shift spaces, in general, are infinite objects, we restrict our attention
to the ones that have some finite presentation, i.e. subshifts of finite type and sofic shifts.

## Installation
To install the library, run script located in `scripts/install.sh` from the main directory level (`symbolic-dynamics`)
```shell
scripts/install.sh
```
This should install the required library (Eigen) and build our library in the `/build` directory

## Examples
To compile and run examples, run script:
```shell
scripts/run_examples.sh
```
